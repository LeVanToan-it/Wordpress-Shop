<h3>Motivation</h3>
I was introduced by b brother in profession to a client who was in need of website design. And fortunately, before that, I researched and designed a personal website for myself at local. So, I just learn more, understand what's thing customer need, consult and deploy it.

Finally, when I hand over the product for my customer, they very satisfied about website, I funny that thing. Therefore, I know this project still very basic. I need learn very much to improve my professional skills.

<h3>How to use my code</h3>
With my project, you must access to project folder. In this folder, it contains file 'backup.wpress' and file 'database.sql'.

Firstly, please install 'XAMPP' app. This is  one of the widely used cross-platform web server, which helps you create and test your program on a local webserver. You need import file 'database.sql' to XAMPP system.
